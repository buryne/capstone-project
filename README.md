# About
Indonesia is a country that is glorious for its tourism potential with a variety of amazing destinations, diverse cultures and stunning natural beauty, but the experience of tourists in exploring the archipelago is still hampered by the lack of integrated information and lack of accessibility of accurate information, so we can make this application, there are many tourist attractions available and can be visited by tourists, this application acts as a friend in determining tourist attractions according to the interests and uniqueness provided by tourist attractions, this can help tourists or application users not to be confused, worried, and so on in choosing or visiting tourist attractions. With the theme "Find and Share Your Travel Journey with Us", this application not only provides recommendations for tourist attractions to users, but users can also share their valuable travel experiences with the community.
